# 🌍 COVID-19 Global Tracker - Data Analysis Project

A data-driven exploratory analysis and visualization project tracking global COVID-19 trends using real-world data from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus).

---

## 📌 Project Objectives

- ✅ Import and clean global COVID-19 data.
- ✅ Analyze time trends in cases, deaths, and vaccinations.
- ✅ Compare key metrics across countries and regions.
- ✅ Visualize the data using informative charts and (optional) maps.
- ✅ Communicate findings in a clear, well-documented Jupyter Notebook.

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries Used

- **Python 3.8+**
- `pandas` – Data wrangling
- `matplotlib` – Plotting
- `seaborn` – Statistical visualizations
- `numpy` – Numeric operations
- `Jupyter Notebook` – Presentation and code integration

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

1. Clone this repository.
2. Download the dataset [`owid-covid-data.csv`]
3. Open the notebook file: `COVID19_Data_Analysis_Report.ipynb` using **Jupyter Notebook** or **VS Code with Python extension**.
4. Ensure you have the required Python libraries installed:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly
    ```
5. Run the notebook cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis.

## 📊 Key Insights

- Countries like the **USA** and **India** saw significant peaks in new cases at different points in time.
- **Kenya** experienced a lower vaccination rate compared to global leaders.
- There’s a visible drop in death rates in regions with higher vaccination coverage.
- Visualization revealed strong correlation patterns between cases and deaths.
- Vaccination campaigns significantly impacted the trajectory of the pandemic.
